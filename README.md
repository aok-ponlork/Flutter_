# e_commerce

This is a project with Flutter that connects to my Laravel API for my Mobile Application, developed during my academic year.

## Features

- User authentication (login/register)
- Product listing and details
- Cart management
- Order management

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Frontend mobile application development
- **Lottie-File**: For animation, adding smooth, interactive animations to the appâ€™s UI.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e_commerce.git
    ```

2. **Flutter Setup**

   - Make sure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the installation guide: [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
   - Install dependencies:

3. **Backend Setup**

   - Clone or download the backend Laravel API.
   - Navigate to the `backend` folder (or wherever you have the Laravel API stored).
